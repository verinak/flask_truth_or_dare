# flask_truth_or_dare

## Description
Small Truth or Dare generator web app made with HTML (Bootstrap) and Python (Flask). I'm not experienced with either frameworks really,
I was just practicing how to use APIs in Python. API used is [Truth or Dare Bot API.](https://docs.truthordarebot.xyz/api-docs)

It's a fairly simple app, you click either truth or dare and the app makes an API call to get a random promt for either truth or dare.
